      <h2>Even though using "lorem ipsum" often arouses curiosity </h2>

      <h4>The text is derived from Cicero's De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum</h4>
      <p>
         Where text is visible in a document, people tend to focus on the textual content rather than upon overall presentation, so publishers use lorem ipsum when displaying a typeface or design in order to direct the focus to presentation. "Lorem ipsum" also approximates a typical distribution of spaces in English.
      </p>
      <h4>Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate</h4>
      <p>
          The most common lorem ipsum text reads as follows: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
      </p>
      <h4>The passage was discovered by Richard McClintock</h4>
      <p>
         The text is derived from Cicero's De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum (On the Ends of Goods and Evils, or alternatively [About] The Purposes of Good and Evil ). The original passage began: Neque porro quisquam est qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet, consectetur, adipisci velit (Translation: "Neither is there anyone who loves grief itself since it is grief and thus wants to obtain it").
      </p>
      <h4>Neque porro quisquam</h4>
      <p>
          The most common lorem ipsum text reads as follows: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
